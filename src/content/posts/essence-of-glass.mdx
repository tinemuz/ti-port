This project sought to capture the beautiful qualities of glass through the design of a futuristic but mundane appliance. The goal was to move beyond simple transparency and explore how light dances as it reflects, refracts, and scatters through a complex form.

To achieve this, an understanding of the material's properties within Blender was essential. The exploration, focused on:

- Index of Refraction (IOR): Fine-tuning the IOR to match real-world glass, which dictates the dramatic bending of light as it passes through the object's unique curves.
- Volumetric Light & Shadow: Mastering the interplay of light and shadow within the volume of the glass itself to create a sense of depth and realism.
- Advanced Caustics: Harnessing Blender's powerful Cycles engine to generate the intricate, focused patterns of light that concentrate on surrounding surfaces
