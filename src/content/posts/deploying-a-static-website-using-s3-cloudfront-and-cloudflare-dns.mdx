### Leveraging AWS S3 for Static Web Hosting with Cloudflare

Having already set up my domains with Cloudflare, I decided to **leverage AWS S3's robust static web hosting capabilities** while minimizing costs. Instead of transferring my domain to Route53, which would have cost **14**, I opted for a cheaper solution by sticking with **Cloudflare**, where I have my domain for **$9**.

### Steps to Achieve This Setup

1. **Create an S3 Bucket:**

   First, create an S3 bucket with your domain name as the bucket name. Enable the S3 website hosting and configure appropriate bucket policies to allow public access if needed.

   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-domain-name --region your-region
   aws s3 website s3://your-domain-name/ --index-document index.html --error-document error.html
   ```

2. **Use CloudFront for Content Delivery:**

   Deploy a CloudFront distribution to deliver static content stored in S3. This step involves setting up a CloudFront distribution and pointing it to your S3 bucket. CloudFront acts as a content delivery network (CDN) that caches your static files, reducing latency and improving the speed of delivering content to users globally.

   > _Tip:_ Ensure you set the **Origin Access Identity (OAI)** in CloudFront so that your S3 bucket only serves content via CloudFront, keeping it secure.

3. **Cloudflare SSL/TLS Configuration:**

   To secure the content delivered from S3 through CloudFront using Cloudflare, generate an SSL certificate in AWS Certificate Manager. Type your domain name and click "Create certificate."

   ```plaintext
   Example CNAME values:
   Name: _abcd.example.com
   Value: _xyz.cloudfront.net
   ```

   > _Important:_ Update your DNS records on Cloudflare to ensure SSL validation. This setup allows secure communication between Cloudflare and users accessing your website.

4. **CloudFront Alternative Domain Name Setup:**

   After creating the CloudFront distribution, you can add an alternative domain name (CNAME) to it. Attach the SSL certificate that you generated and validated earlier via a CNAME record in CloudFront. This ensures secure and efficient delivery of your static website content through Cloudflareâ€™s global network.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can deploy a static website using **AWS S3 for storage**, **Amazon CloudFront for distribution**, and **Cloudflare for domain management** and SSL/TLS termination.

> _Pro Tip:_ This solution helps you achieve **cost efficiency** while maintaining **high performance** with global content delivery.
